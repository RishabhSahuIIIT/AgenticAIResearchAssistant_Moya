This task is facing many \nobstacles which make it somehow challenging. The software size \nand how accurately it has been measured greatly affects the \naccuracy of the estimation. Also project management plays vital \nrole in guiding such estimation processes. A lot of research effort \nhas been accomplished which reflects the increasing demands of \nhigh quality software through effective cost estimation.   \nPurpose: To summarize and differentiate existing literature \nrelated to the cost estimation methods and techniques as away to \nidentify estimation model fundamentals based on the analysis of \nthe already available cost estimation models, also trying to \nidentify the possible gaps in this research area.    \nScheme: The methodology is based on the survey research \nmethod with well defined steps. \nOutcomes: The survey search process found as preliminary \nresults 274 papers associated to our topic from strong online \ndatabases, around 20 papers have been included in this survey and \nonly 13 studies were selected for in-depth analysis. Data were \nextracted from these studies and synthesized in respect to the \nformulated Research questions .The survey results has shown that \nthere are many models for cost estimation and the challenge is \nwhich one to use in specific software context, but still there are \nsome commonly used models in both industry and academia. \nConclusion: The result of our work confirm that in order to have \nan accurate estimation process many software metrics need to be \nanalyzed and used in estimation model or in a combination of \nmodels, and the estimation of software needs a lot of data and \ninputs to be accurate to meets expectation, this can be achieved \nusing benchmarking of datasets. \n \nCategories and Subject Descriptors \nKnowledge Engineering, Information and Communication for \ndeveloping, Technologies as Teaching Strategy. \nGeneral Terms \nEstimation, Design,  Standardization. \nKeywords \nCost \nEstimation, \nSoftware \nMetrics, \nSoftware \nProcess, \nAlgorithmic and non algorithmic Models. \n1. INTRODUCTION \nIn software cost estimation research area there is a lot of work   \nOther has been replaced with a new model and in fact no model \ncan be used or fit all types of projects[1]. Using such models \nassists the estimation process and support project management \ndecision making, planning and feasibility study[2].  \nThere are many aspects affect the estimation process such as \nunrealistic deadlines imposed over the project, the validity of the \nmodel used to measure the software size, software complexity \n[3]available budget and finally the risk of uncertainty of the \nestimated software .So the effectiveness of an estimation process \ndepends on the used methods that measure it.  \nThrough our analysis of the included literature we found that the \nmain categorization of estimation models as algorithmic or non-\nalgorithmic. The algorithmic models are sometimes called \nparametric which are based on mathematical formulas and \nspecific measures of attributes related to the project [4], on the \nother hand the non-algorithmic models are theoretical and based \non heuristics and require a good knowledge to estimate \nproperly[4] .The paper scope is to classify most of the well known \nstudies at software estimation model based on our research \nmethodology. In addition, the main contribution of this paper is \nthe comprehensive survey of the software development estimation \nstudies.This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the \nresearch description. Section 3 presents literature review. Section \n4 presents preliminary of results. A conclusion is presented in \nsection 5.  \n2.

PRELIMINARY RESULTS \n4.1 Data Extraction \nBy reading full text paper and define main items that will form \nstudy basics, also we have summarized many cost estimation \nmodels briefly and we have listed main advantages and \ndisadvantages for each, (Tables 3 & 4) shows the items that were \nextracted from papers. \n \n4.2 Evidence Synthesis \nThrough data synthesis we have answer the research questions \nthrough data extracted from studies. \nAnswers for the first What Question: \nAlgorithmic and Non-Algorithmic Cost Estimation models \n\n\nThere are two categories of cost estimation models; algorithmic \nand non algorithmic as shown in Table 4.The algorithmic models \nare clear repeatable and uses formulas and equations to calculate \nthe cost, it may be further categorized as linear, non linear or \nquadratic, while the non algorithmic cost modeling rely on \nanalysis, heuristics and sometimes require knowledge to conduct \nthe cost of software.[4]  Some researchers have discussed the \nexisting models within A priori and A posteriori contexts. In A \npriori the models estimate the software early to help in decision \nmaking. On the other hand the A posteriori models rely on data \nfrom previous projects which is commonly used[11].In addition \nthere is many other approaches including:  \nLexical analysis of requirement, genetic programming, soft \ncomputing, and bootstrap-based analogy cost estimation that \nmostly in research area and researchers tries to combine it with \nother models [12]. \n \nAnswers for the Which Question: \nA comparison has been conducted among the models and we \nfound that the most commonly used model is the algorithmic \nCOCOMO model due to its benefits briefly shown in Table 4, \nother widely used models is the Expert Judgment as a non \nalgorithmic model which the organization uses to reduce the cost \nof estimation and its accurate to some level as long as there is an \nexpert, knowledge and data to rely on. \nAs we can see from Table 3, there are different inputs and \nparameters that are needed to estimate the cost using a model, \nsoftware metrics are attribute [8] of a software system or process \nattributes that can be measured numerically. Those are metrics \nthat must be identified and selected  such as size metrics:[13] \nLOC based size, Function point (FP) based size , Object oriented \n(OO) based size and  Use case point (UCP)based size(Pressman \n2007).Another metrics are related to complexity such as Halstead \nComplexity Metric (HCM)(Software Science)[2] and Cyclomatic \nComplexity Metric (CCM) [3].Now the relation between \nestimation models, processes and metrics is somehow clear \nthrough our results as shown simply in Figure 2. \n \nAnswers for the second What Question: \n It's important to note that no estimation model is appropriate and \ncan handle all software project types [14]. \nAlso  there are many challenges that faces managers in estimating \nthe costs as they commonly rely on standard metrics-based \nestimation models[15].  \nAnd as a result of our survey we found that the best practice for \ncost estimation is a combination of models to gain the best of it, \nalso an important thing to mention that software metrics is a vital \npart of the estimation process.\"Software metrics let you know \nwhen to laugh and when to cry \" [13], as it’s the building blocks \nand inputs to the estimation models. Finally we found that the \naccurate models are the one that let us calibrate and tune data for \nthe used model. \nBased on the results of our survey we recommend the use of \nbenchmarking as away to estimate the software effort, size, cost \nand also its duration and to enhance the exiting algorithmic \nmodels. The ISBGS (The International Software Benchmarking \nStandards Group) which is repository for a huge number of \nprojects and their related data can be used for benchmarking [16] . \nAlso we need models that can handle uncertitnity in an \nappropriate way. \nEstimation experimental studies are mainly based on datasets, the \nmost commonly used datasets both simple and complex includes \nAlbrecht dataset, Desharnais dataset, Maxwell dataset and ISBSG \n(International Software Benchmarking Standards Group)[16], \nwhich are repositories for many real world data related to real \nprojects, for the ISBSG it is widely used and encompasses large \nnumber of projects but due to the heterogeneous characteristic of \nit, it's recommended to extract an appropriate subset to use it in \ncost estimation activities. \n \nTable 4.

Fuzzy Logic take care of values \nwith partially truth [17]. \n- Used whenever the available information are  \n  Uncertain or ambiguous (Fuzzy)[9]. \n- Flexible and simple to understand as it \n   reflects the logic of humans[17]. \n- Not clear process so it's not widely used \n   And accepted by estimators. \nNeural Networks: consist of neurons and levels, \nthere connections that let attributes to pass through. \n- Facilitate and enable the solution of some  \n  difficult problems in cost estimation[14]. \n-  Not easy process so it's not widely used \n    And accepted by estimators. \n5. CONCLUSION  \nWe survey the state of the art in cost estimation research area in \norder to gain a clear picture of the estimation models, and we \nhave conducted that there are some dominant models that is used \nrepeatedly but that does not prove its validity in all context of the  \nMeasured software .Also there is the uncertitnity risk in software \nwhich requires more accurate and suitable models to predict it. \nAs future work we are studying the ISBSG data set to understand \nits available data items ,also we plan to enhance existing cost \nestimation models or contribute in the estimation process as a \nwhole within the software cost estimation field.    \n6.

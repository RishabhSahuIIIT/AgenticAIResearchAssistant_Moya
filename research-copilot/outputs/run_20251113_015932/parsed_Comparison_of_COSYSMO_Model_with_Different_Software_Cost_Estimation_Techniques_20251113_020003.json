To estimate cost for software is the main portions of any \nproject type and right estimation of cost for the software will \nhelp in completing project in of time and budget. Proper cost \nestimation of a software project is highly needed to avoid any \nrisk failure. So, there is a strong need to calculate the project’s \ncost annually and compare it to the other techniques. This paper \ndeals with the analysis and comparison of COCOMO model of \nBoehm’s and COSYSMO model of Valerdi’s through the help of \nformulae’s and an online tool present at the CSSE website. For \nthis we have used the COCOMO dataset and it has been \nobserved that COSYSMO model works better than the \nCOCOMO model in every aspect. \n \nKeywords- SCE-Software cost estimation, software cost \nestimation \nmethods, \nCOCOMO-Cost \nconstructive \nmodel,                 \nCSSE-Centre for Systems and Software Engineering Website, PM- \nPerson Month, KLOC-Kilo lines of code. \n \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \n \nCost estimation of any software project is process of an \ngeneric estimated value of the cost idea of a product, program, \nproject, which is basically computed on the basis of collected \ninformation (1). Software cost estimation is among one of the \nsoftware development activity which basically focus on how \nto estimates of associated and calculations of time and \nstipulated effort with project. The accurate cost estimation at \nthe starting stage of the project is very important for avoiding \nany risk failures. If somehow fail to estimate then it would \nresult the cost of the project to be very high and consequently \nreaching 150-200% more than the original cost (2). But there \nare many it difficulties to estimate this cost effectively. \n \nThere are different methods for the estimation of cost in \nsoftware engineering: \n \n1. Expert Judgment (Expertise Based) \n2. Top - Down \n3. Bottom – Up \n4. Algorithmic (Parametric) model \n5. Price to Win Estimation \n6. Estimation by Analogy \n \nFrank Freiman in 1960 developed the PRICE model for \nhardware which subsequently began the history of SCE. In \n1970 the researchers used correlation and regression \ntechniques to analyze many projects and attempts to the factor  \n \nidentification which directly implies to affect the cost of the \nany software development. (3, 4) \n \n \nCOCOMO is divided into further three levels-The first \nlevel, Basic COCOMO model is proficient for very early, fast \nand order of software roughly for finding the estimate costs. \nThe second level is Intermediate COCOMO which is based on \nthe cost drivers and the third level is detailed/completed \nCOCOMO considers for the control of different phases of \nproject. In 2002, another model was made by Ricardo Valerdi \nknown as COSYSMO stands for Constructive System \nEngineering Cost Model) (5). It gives an estimate in the form \nof person-months. COCOMO works only for software projects \nbut COSYSMO works for both hardware and software projects. \nCalculations of COSYSMO are based on the estimates of size \nof project, which is calculated in terms of four size drivers. On \nthe other hand COCOMO uses less cost drivers whereas \nCOSYSMO model uses more cost drivers and functionality \nwhich directly upgrades our process to estimate the cost. \nCOCOMO is based on a software tradition approach and \nmainly focuses specifically on software development life cycle \nphases which are being defined by MBASE2 while COSYSMO \nprovided by ISO/IEC 15288(6). \n   \nHere, the usage of COSYSMO approach has proposed for \nthe cost of software project calculation. It has been found this \ntechnique is much better than the cost of other estimation \nprocedures for accuracy view. In this paper had made the \ncomparisons between the COCOMO model and COSYSMO \nmodel with the help of formulae’s and an online tool present at \nthe CSSE (Center for Systems and Software Engineering) \nwebsite. \nII. \nLITERATURE SURVEY \n \nIn the last four decades, various effort estimation models \nhave been implemented. Function Point Analysis (FPA) and \nCOCOMO model are the most frequently used methods for \nestimating cost and effort of software projects. Literature survey \nrefers to some of the research papers which we have used and \nstudied for conducting our experiments. \n \nFPA is an approach to estimate size and complexity for \nsoftware function that are delivered to the user. This method \nfails to deal with non-linear and interactions between the kind \nand effort taken. This metric firstly measures the functionality \nwhich is involved by the count of the input, output, logical and \nqueries which have been included by the software program. \nThese types of counts are weighted and depending upon the \ndifficulties involved modified by fourteen “complexity factors”. \nSome years ago, A modelling techniques have been proposed \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.

In analogy \nbased cost estimation, a major role has been played by \nsimilarity measures between a pair of projects (10). These \nmodels calculate the distance between the current software \nproject and past software projects and then finds conclusions \nfor the most similar project. (11). \n  \nFurther many researchers tried to develop an efficient and \neffective model for the determination of the cost of a model \nbut the approaches which they have used somehow lacked in \none sense or the other. Main problem in  cost estimation \nprocess of any software is the data accessibility which is \nneeded to verify the accuracy of any proposed models, metrics \nand functional techniques[3].Some other challenges could be \nthe uncertainty which are involved at the starting of the \nproject. There arouse many cases in which the client itself is \nnot very clear about the whole complete requirement. \nEstimation also plays an important factor as it must be done by \nthe developer or in assistance with the developer. Sometimes \nthe estimation is not done by the developer which may directly \nleads to huge mismatch. \n \nIII. \nMETHODOLOGY \n \nFocusing and dealing with the two methods which are \nCOCOMO model and COSYSMO model. Methodology refers \nto the methods which we have used i.e. COCOMO model \nCOSYSMO model. \n \nCOCOMO basically is of three types-1.Basic \nCOCOMO model \n \n2. Intermediate COCOMO model \n \n3. Complete/Detailed COCOMO model \n \n \nTable I \nBasic COCOMO COEFFICIENTS \n \nCOCOMO is applied to three classes of projects: \n \n1. Organic projects -small sized project typically \n2-250 KLOC, experienced developers in the \nknown environment, not tight deadline. \n2. Semi-detached projects – Size is minimum \nprojects typically 60-400 KLOC, average \nexperience \non \nsimilar \nproject, \nmedium \ndeadline. \n3. Embedded projects – large project typically \nover 300 KLOC, little bit previous experience, \nhard deadline.  \nBasic COCOMO equation- \nEffort Applied (E) = a*(size)b*EAF [ man-months ] Where,  \nEAF- Effort Adjustment Factor Size- Lines of code of your \nproject. \nCOSYSMO is an open model that includes the eighteen \ndifferent parameters: \n \n1. \n4 size drivers \n \n2. \n14 effort multipliers. \n \nIt build on some architecture which is similar to COCOMO II, \nand integrates with the accepted engineering of system \nstandards to define its diversity [13].The COSYSMO \ncalculations are based on the estimates of a size of project cost, \nwhich has been measured in terms of four size drivers: \n \n• \nRequirements \n \n• \nInterfaces \n \n• \nAlgorithms \n• \nScenarios \nThe basic COSYSMO equations take the form-is taken to be \nless than 1 for small projects and great than equal to 1 for large \nprojects. The value of effort multiplier is chosen from the \nabove mentioned rely cost driver table. \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.

ABSTRACT 
Context: Cost estimation of software projects is critical activity 
which requires the use of proper techniques and methods in order 
to have a good estimation results. This task is facing many 
obstacles which make it somehow challenging. The software size 
and how accurately it has been measured greatly affects the 
accuracy of the estimation. Also project management plays vital 
role in guiding such estimation processes. A lot of research effort 
has been accomplished which reflects the increasing demands of 
high quality software through effective cost estimation.   
Purpose: To summarize and differentiate existing literature 
related to the cost estimation methods and techniques as away to 
identify estimation model fundamentals based on the analysis of 
the already available cost estimation models, also trying to 
identify the possible gaps in this research area.    
Scheme: The methodology is based on the survey research 
method with well defined steps. 
Outcomes: The survey search process found as preliminary 
results 274 papers associated to our topic from strong online 
databases, around 20 papers have been included in this survey and 
only 13 studies were selected for in-depth analysis. Data were 
extracted from these studies and synthesized in respect to the 
formulated Research questions .The survey results has shown that 
there are many models for cost estimation and the challenge is 
which one to use in specific software context, but still there are 
some commonly used models in both industry and academia. 
Conclusion: The result of our work confirm that in order to have 
an accurate estimation process many software metrics need to be 
analyzed and used in estimation model or in a combination of 
models, and the estimation of software needs a lot of data and 
inputs to be accurate to meets expectation, this can be achieved 
using benchmarking of datasets.

1. INTRODUCTION 
In software cost estimation research area there is a lot of work   
Other has been replaced with a new model and in fact no model 
can be used or fit all types of projects[1]. Using such models 
assists the estimation process and support project management 
decision making, planning and feasibility study[2].  
There are many aspects affect the estimation process such as 
unrealistic deadlines imposed over the project, the validity of the 
model used to measure the software size, software complexity 
[3]available budget and finally the risk of uncertainty of the 
estimated software .So the effectiveness of an estimation process 
depends on the used methods that measure it.  
Through our analysis of the included literature we found that the 
main categorization of estimation models as algorithmic or non-
algorithmic. The algorithmic models are sometimes called 
parametric which are based on mathematical formulas and 
specific measures of attributes related to the project [4], on the 
other hand the non-algorithmic models are theoretical and based 
on heuristics and require a good knowledge to estimate 
properly[4] .The paper scope is to classify most of the well known 
studies at software estimation model based on our research 
methodology. In addition, the main contribution of this paper is 
the comprehensive survey of the software development estimation 
studies.This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the 
research description. Section 3 presents literature review. Section 
4 presents preliminary of results. A conclusion is presented in 
section 5.

Figure1. Survey Process 
Mainly we focus on papers within the (2007-2015) interval and 
well known publications from online databases which is relevant 
to our topic and research questions by analyzing and interpreting 
the studies based on the survey methodology [5]. 
2.2 Research Framework 
 The research was oriented on the main research questions that 
identify and implicitly include concepts and aspects that form a 
conceptual framework in which the survey try to analyze 
comprehensively. This conceptual framework is a starting point 
that help our research to be successful and replicated and define 
structure of our review, in addition it's important to identify the 
estimation process [6] here as a process that elaborate estimation 
methods, techniques or models and consider the metrics that 
affect the software cost in a clear set of steps that estimate the cost 
of a project[7], finally software metrics are attribute [8] of a 
software system or process attributes that can be measured 
numerically we will briefly discuss those metrics( See Figure 2).

4. PRELIMINARY RESULTS 
4.1 Data Extraction 
By reading full text paper and define main items that will form 
study basics, also we have summarized many cost estimation 
models briefly and we have listed main advantages and 
disadvantages for each, (Tables 3 & 4) shows the items that were 
extracted from papers. 
 
4.2 Evidence Synthesis 
Through data synthesis we have answer the research questions 
through data extracted from studies. 
Answers for the first What Question: 
Algorithmic and Non-Algorithmic Cost Estimation models 


There are two categories of cost estimation models; algorithmic 
and non algorithmic as shown in Table 4.The algorithmic models 
are clear repeatable and uses formulas and equations to calculate 
the cost, it may be further categorized as linear, non linear or 
quadratic, while the non algorithmic cost modeling rely on 
analysis, heuristics and sometimes require knowledge to conduct 
the cost of software.[4]  Some researchers have discussed the 
existing models within A priori and A posteriori contexts. In A 
priori the models estimate the software early to help in decision 
making. On the other hand the A posteriori models rely on data 
from previous projects which is commonly used[11].In addition 
there is many other approaches including:  
Lexical analysis of requirement, genetic programming, soft 
computing, and bootstrap-based analogy cost estimation that 
mostly in research area and researchers tries to combine it with 
other models [12]. 
 
Answers for the Which Question: 
A comparison has been conducted among the models and we 
found that the most commonly used model is the algorithmic 
COCOMO model due to its benefits briefly shown in Table 4, 
other widely used models is the Expert Judgment as a non 
algorithmic model which the organization uses to reduce the cost 
of estimation and its accurate to some level as long as there is an 
expert, knowledge and data to rely on. 
As we can see from Table 3, there are different inputs and 
parameters that are needed to estimate the cost using a model, 
software metrics are attribute [8] of a software system or process 
attributes that can be measured numerically. Those are metrics 
that must be identified and selected  such as size metrics:[13] 
LOC based size, Function point (FP) based size , Object oriented 
(OO) based size and  Use case point (UCP)based size(Pressman 
2007).Another metrics are related to complexity such as Halstead 
Complexity Metric (HCM)(Software Science)[2] and Cyclomatic 
Complexity Metric (CCM) [3].Now the relation between 
estimation models, processes and metrics is somehow clear 
through our results as shown simply in Figure 2. 
 
Answers for the second What Question: 
 It's important to note that no estimation model is appropriate and 
can handle all software project types [14]. 
Also  there are many challenges that faces managers in estimating 
the costs as they commonly rely on standard metrics-based 
estimation models[15].  
And as a result of our survey we found that the best practice for 
cost estimation is a combination of models to gain the best of it, 
also an important thing to mention that software metrics is a vital 
part of the estimation process."Software metrics let you know 
when to laugh and when to cry " [13], as it’s the building blocks 
and inputs to the estimation models. Finally we found that the 
accurate models are the one that let us calibrate and tune data for 
the used model. 
Based on the results of our survey we recommend the use of 
benchmarking as away to estimate the software effort, size, cost 
and also its duration and to enhance the exiting algorithmic 
models. The ISBGS (The International Software Benchmarking 
Standards Group) which is repository for a huge number of 
projects and their related data can be used for benchmarking [16] . 
Also we need models that can handle uncertitnity in an 
appropriate way. 
Estimation experimental studies are mainly based on datasets, the 
most commonly used datasets both simple and complex includes 
Albrecht dataset, Desharnais dataset, Maxwell dataset and ISBSG 
(International Software Benchmarking Standards Group)[16], 
which are repositories for many real world data related to real 
projects, for the ISBSG it is widely used and encompasses large 
number of projects but due to the heterogeneous characteristic of 
it, it's recommended to extract an appropriate subset to use it in 
cost estimation activities.

5. CONCLUSION  
We survey the state of the art in cost estimation research area in 
order to gain a clear picture of the estimation models, and we 
have conducted that there are some dominant models that is used 
repeatedly but that does not prove its validity in all context of the  
Measured software .Also there is the uncertitnity risk in software 
which requires more accurate and suitable models to predict it. 
As future work we are studying the ISBSG data set to understand 
its available data items ,also we plan to enhance existing cost 
estimation models or contribute in the estimation process as a 
whole within the software cost estimation field.

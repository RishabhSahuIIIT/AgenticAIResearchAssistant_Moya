Abstract— Cost Estimation of any software is process of 
evaluating the estimating cost and effort which is must necessary 
to build any software system or project for increasing the output. 
The basic input is the cost drivers set and the size of code and the 
output is the effort which is calculated in terms of Person-Months 
(PM’s). To estimate cost for software is the main portions of any 
project type and right estimation of cost for the software will 
help in completing project in of time and budget. Proper cost 
estimation of a software project is highly needed to avoid any 
risk failure. So, there is a strong need to calculate the project’s 
cost annually and compare it to the other techniques. This paper 
deals with the analysis and comparison of COCOMO model of 
Boehm’s and COSYSMO model of Valerdi’s through the help of 
formulae’s and an online tool present at the CSSE website. For 
this we have used the COCOMO dataset and it has been 
observed that COSYSMO model works better than the 
COCOMO model in every aspect.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Cost estimation of any software project is process of an 
generic estimated value of the cost idea of a product, program, 
project, which is basically computed on the basis of collected 
information (1). Software cost estimation is among one of the 
software development activity which basically focus on how 
to estimates of associated and calculations of time and 
stipulated effort with project. The accurate cost estimation at 
the starting stage of the project is very important for avoiding 
any risk failures. If somehow fail to estimate then it would 
result the cost of the project to be very high and consequently 
reaching 150-200% more than the original cost (2). But there 
are many it difficulties to estimate this cost effectively. 
 
There are different methods for the estimation of cost in 
software engineering: 
 
1. Expert Judgment (Expertise Based) 
2. Top - Down 
3. Bottom – Up 
4. Algorithmic (Parametric) model 
5. Price to Win Estimation 
6. Estimation by Analogy 
 
Frank Freiman in 1960 developed the PRICE model for 
hardware which subsequently began the history of SCE. In 
1970 the researchers used correlation and regression 
techniques to analyze many projects and attempts to the factor  
 
identification which directly implies to affect the cost of the 
any software development. (3, 4) 
 
 
COCOMO is divided into further three levels-The first 
level, Basic COCOMO model is proficient for very early, fast 
and order of software roughly for finding the estimate costs. 
The second level is Intermediate COCOMO which is based on 
the cost drivers and the third level is detailed/completed 
COCOMO considers for the control of different phases of 
project. In 2002, another model was made by Ricardo Valerdi 
known as COSYSMO stands for Constructive System 
Engineering Cost Model) (5). It gives an estimate in the form 
of person-months. COCOMO works only for software projects 
but COSYSMO works for both hardware and software projects. 
Calculations of COSYSMO are based on the estimates of size 
of project, which is calculated in terms of four size drivers. On 
the other hand COCOMO uses less cost drivers whereas 
COSYSMO model uses more cost drivers and functionality 
which directly upgrades our process to estimate the cost. 
COCOMO is based on a software tradition approach and 
mainly focuses specifically on software development life cycle 
phases which are being defined by MBASE2 while COSYSMO 
provided by ISO/IEC 15288(6). 
   
Here, the usage of COSYSMO approach has proposed for 
the cost of software project calculation. It has been found this 
technique is much better than the cost of other estimation 
procedures for accuracy view. In this paper had made the 
comparisons between the COCOMO model and COSYSMO 
model with the help of formulae’s and an online tool present at 
the CSSE (Center for Systems and Software Engineering) 
website. 
II. 
LITERATURE SURVEY 
 
In the last four decades, various effort estimation models 
have been implemented. Function Point Analysis (FPA) and 
COCOMO model are the most frequently used methods for 
estimating cost and effort of software projects. Literature survey 
refers to some of the research papers which we have used and 
studied for conducting our experiments. 
 
FPA is an approach to estimate size and complexity for 
software function that are delivered to the user. This method 
fails to deal with non-linear and interactions between the kind 
and effort taken. This metric firstly measures the functionality 
which is involved by the count of the input, output, logical and 
queries which have been included by the software program. 
These types of counts are weighted and depending upon the 
difficulties involved modified by fourteen “complexity factors”. 
Some years ago, A modelling techniques have been proposed

which contain artificial neural networks (ANN), fuzzy 
techniques and analogy-based reasoning (2, 9). In analogy 
based cost estimation, a major role has been played by 
similarity measures between a pair of projects (10). These 
models calculate the distance between the current software 
project and past software projects and then finds conclusions 
for the most similar project. (11). 
  
Further many researchers tried to develop an efficient and 
effective model for the determination of the cost of a model 
but the approaches which they have used somehow lacked in 
one sense or the other. Main problem in  cost estimation 
process of any software is the data accessibility which is 
needed to verify the accuracy of any proposed models, metrics 
and functional techniques[3].Some other challenges could be 
the uncertainty which are involved at the starting of the 
project. There arouse many cases in which the client itself is 
not very clear about the whole complete requirement. 
Estimation also plays an important factor as it must be done by 
the developer or in assistance with the developer. Sometimes 
the estimation is not done by the developer which may directly 
leads to huge mismatch.

METHODOLOGY 
 
Focusing and dealing with the two methods which are 
COCOMO model and COSYSMO model. Methodology refers 
to the methods which we have used i.e. COCOMO model 
COSYSMO model. 
 
COCOMO basically is of three types-1.Basic 
COCOMO model 
 
2. Intermediate COCOMO model 
 
3. Complete/Detailed COCOMO model 
 
 
Table I 
Basic COCOMO COEFFICIENTS 
 
COCOMO is applied to three classes of projects: 
 
1. Organic projects -small sized project typically 
2-250 KLOC, experienced developers in the 
known environment, not tight deadline. 
2. Semi-detached projects – Size is minimum 
projects typically 60-400 KLOC, average 
experience 
on 
similar 
project, 
medium 
deadline. 
3. Embedded projects – large project typically 
over 300 KLOC, little bit previous experience, 
hard deadline.  
Basic COCOMO equation- 
Effort Applied (E) = a*(size)b*EAF [ man-months ] Where,  
EAF- Effort Adjustment Factor Size- Lines of code of your 
project. 
COSYSMO is an open model that includes the eighteen 
different parameters: 
 
1. 
4 size drivers 
 
2. 
14 effort multipliers. 
 
It build on some architecture which is similar to COCOMO II, 
and integrates with the accepted engineering of system 
standards to define its diversity [13].The COSYSMO 
calculations are based on the estimates of a size of project cost, 
which has been measured in terms of four size drivers: 
 
• 
Requirements 
 
• 
Interfaces 
 
• 
Algorithms 
• 
Scenarios 
The basic COSYSMO equations take the form-is taken to be 
less than 1 for small projects and great than equal to 1 for large 
projects. The value of effort multiplier is chosen from the 
above mentioned rely cost driver table.

In order to make the required comparison we have used 
theoretical formulae for obtaining the results. 
 
The value of calibration factor is a constant and is taken 
to be 2.94.Furthermore, the value of scale factor For 
calculating cost using COSYSMO Model we have  
For the value of size and EAF we would refer the data set 
given in table 4. 
 
For the calculations we have used the above data set[2]. 
This dataset contains two independent variables- 
 Size and EAF (Effort Adjustment Factor).  
 Size is in KLOC (thousands of lines of codes).

RESULTS 
 
Now the table 5 shows the comparison between COCOMO 
and COSYSMO using theoretical formulae. Result analysis 
with the help of formulae’s (manually) and with the help of 
tool. Section 5-Finally the proposed work is concluded with 
the references and future scope. 
 
From the calculations we observed that COCOMO model 
requires more effort in person months as compared to 
COSYSMO model which basically shows that COSYSMO is 
a better approach as compared to COCOMO model. 
 
Furthermore, the same results could also be obtained by the 
help of tool present on the CSSE website. The tool also draws 
a comparison between the two models and proves that 
COSYSMO approach is far better than the COCOMO 
approach for calculating the cost of a project.

CONCLUSIONS 
This paper proposed the difference between the 
COCOMO model and COSYSMO model for estimating cost 
in terms of effort in person-months. As per simulations result 
by using the COCOMO dataset, COSYSMO generates the 
new project cost in much correct manner compared to the 
COCOMO. 
 
Till now the tool could only be used for large lines of 
codes but it can also be enhanced to give efficient results using 
less line of codes.
